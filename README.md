Project Name:
Run Person, Run!
Name:
Owen Storbeck
Description:
An app that allows a person to track the distance and the times that they log in when they go for runs as exercise.  What I want to do is allow the person to log in the times and keep them as in like a journal.  Then they can put the distance in and get a generated pace from every mile as well (so time/mile average for each run).  What they would also do is try to compare what they have either daily, weekly, or monthly.  So they track progress, but I wanted to also add in a descripton.  Like a rate of the run they go on, from a one star to five star scale.  Then depending on the user-rating of the run, there is advice given from the app on what they should do, like stretch more before, rest longer, drink more water before and after, etc.
I want to build this because recently, I got into running from a friend, and I use an app that tracks my runs, but I want a more personal experience with it,  as the RunTracker app that I use does track my pace and calories, but doesn't give the questions (personal feel) that I want to bring to the table.
UML Class:
I will design everything, so the user input of scanner class, the app actually trying to keep the data of all the person implements in their run tracker, the app putting in a rate of the runs a person goes on, the app getting feedback from the person, the app giving suggestions to the person after their run, the new input the person gives each time they log in their run entries.
User --> MileAmount int, MinuteAmount int, RunRating int, RunDescription String,
